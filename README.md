## Project Description

This assignment assesses the front-end development skills of replicating a provided design using plain HTML and CSS. The project must be fully responsive on desktop, tablet, and mobile, without relying on frameworks.
## Technologies Used

The technologies used to build the project are:

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Google Fonts
- Color Picker
- Cloudinary for image hosting


##Explanation:

The HTML code defines the basic structure of the collage, including two divs: one for the images and one for the text content.
The CSS code styles the collage and the text content.
The .collage class is used to style the grid container that holds the images.
The grid-template-columns property defines the number of columns in the grid. In this case, we're using repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr)) to create a grid with as many columns as possible, but each column must be at least 300px wide and take up no more than one fraction of the available space.
The gap property defines the spacing between the images.
The .collage img selector styles the images in the collage.
The .text-content class styles the text content below the collage.
You can customize the styles in the CSS code to match your preferences.
